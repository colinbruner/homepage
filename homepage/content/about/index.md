Hello, I'm Colin Bruner. I'm currently working at Verisign as a Site Reliability Engineer
and enjoy playing with new technologies, designing systems, and writing code (Python/Go).

Not really big into websites, but I spun this one up to host on a local Raspberry Pi 3 b+
cluster, in hopes to play around a bit with deploying an application to Kubernetes.

Currently working on learning Kubernetes and studying for the AWS Solutions Architect 
certifications.
