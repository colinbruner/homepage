title = "About Me"
+++

Welcome! My name is Colin Bruner; I'm an IT Engineer living in Arlington, Virginia. 
I've decided to set up this blog initially to be something of an "example app";
it's running on a home cluster of [raspberry pi][rpi] using [k3s][k3s].
However, I think I'd like to build it out and write a little bit about me 
personally.

So, about me!

Professionally, I enjoy IT and designing services/applications. My current 
professional endeavor is leading the design of [saltstack][salt] on 20k 
hosts in both traditional "on-prem" and [private-cloud][oss] environments.

At home, I tinker with various automation projects using Salt, learning k3s,
and HAProxy. I'm also learning [rust][rust], which has been an incredibly 
novel process for me given the lack formal computer science background.

Personally, I enjoy being with family and friends, riding bikes and baking 
food with my girlfriend, drinking craft beer or wine, reading books 
(Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Historical, and Philosophy), lifting weights at the gym, 
and just being outside in the sunlight.
