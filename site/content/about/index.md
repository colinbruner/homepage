Welcome! My name is Colin Bruner; I'm an IT Engineer living in Arlington, Virginia. 
I've decided to set up this little blog as an excuse to setup some infrastructure and
maybe even share some thoughts.

So, about me!

Professionally, I enjoy IT and designing services/applications. Most of my
work takes place within AWS using [Terraform][terraform] to build and orchestrate
cloud resources. A lot of my recent focus has been in moving towards using ECS
as a container scheduling and orchestration platform.

Personally, I enjoy being with family and friends, riding bikes and baking 
food with my fianc√©e, drinking craft beer or wine, reading books 
(Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Historical, and Philosophy), lifting weights at the gym, 
and just being outside in the sunlight.
