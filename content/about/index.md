title = "About Me"

Welcome! My name is Colin Bruner; I'm a Platform Engineer living in Arlington, Virginia. 

I've decided to set up this little blog as a way to kill some time, document my experiences, 
and share some personal thoughts.

So, about me!

Professionally, I enjoy thinking about designing services/applications on a distributed scale.
I've worked a bit in Azure, but predominantly within AWS using [Terraform][terraform] to build and
manage cloud resources. 

Personally, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, riding bikes and baking food with my 
fianc√©e, drinking craft beer or wine, reading books (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Historical, and Philosophy), 
lifting weights at the gym, and just being outside in the sunlight!
